# Movie Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation engine built using both content-based and 
collaborative filtering techniques.

## Features
- Content-based filtering using TF-IDF
- Cosine similarity for movie recommendations
- User preference modelling
- Clean, explainable ML pipeline

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How It Works
1. TF-IDF vectorizes movie descriptions.
2. Cosine similarity matrix computes closeness between movies.
3. System returns top-N similar movies based on user input.

## Why This Project Matters
Recommendation systems are one of the most practical ML applications used in:
- E-commerce
- Streaming platforms
- Personalized marketing

This project demonstrates strong ML foundations and practical application.
